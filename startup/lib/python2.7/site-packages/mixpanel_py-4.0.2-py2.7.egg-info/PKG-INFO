        ===============
        This is the official Mixpanel Python library. This library allows for server-side integration of Mixpanel.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        The library can be installed using pip:
        
            pip install mixpanel-py
        
        Getting Started
        ---------------
        Typical usage usually looks like this:
        
            #!/usr/bin/env python
            from mixpanel import Mixpanel
        
            mp = Mixpanel(YOUR_TOKEN)
        
            # tracks an event with certain properties
            mp.track(USER_ID, 'button clicked', {'color' : 'blue', 'size': 'large'})
        
            # sends an update to a user profile
            mp.people_set(USER_ID, {'$first_name' : 'Amy', 'favorite color': 'red'})
